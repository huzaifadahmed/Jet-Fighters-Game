# Jet-Fighters-Game
My first attempt at coding a program using python.

-------------------------------------------------
To get my foot in the door, into the world of python, I decided to code a simple game using the pygame library.
This project helped me learn some of the basic syntax of python, along with helping me practice some logical statements.
Future plans for this project would be to add a intro screen, a pause feature, and more difficulty levels.
